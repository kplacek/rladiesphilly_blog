      <description>Our May Event! The May R-Ladies meetup took place on May 16, 2018 at Drexel’s LeBow School of Business. Thanks for hosting us again, Drexel, and thanks to our sponsors Datacamp and the R consortium!
Our topic for May was version control using the popular resources Git and GitHub, and we focused on integrating version control with R.
 Intro Darina and I started with an example to illustrate the utility of version control in collaborating on a document or project over time.</description>

      <description>Our April Event! The April R-Ladies meetup was held on April 19th at Drexel. Thanks again to Drexel for hosting us and to DataCamp and the R consortium for sponsoring us!
Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of “Text Mining with R” by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson.
There was a great group - including some new faces!
 Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together.</description>
